    <td>In the lesson I learnt about the basics of Python, I completed 2 interactive lessons on the website which were fun to work through because of the way you were told how to do them. One of the exercises I did, Python Syntax, taught me all the basics I needed to know. An open mind was useful so that I could understand everything. The way I was able to learn easily is because of that reason
