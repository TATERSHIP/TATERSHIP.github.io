    <td>In today's lesson I worked on date and time, which is a very useful topic to know about as I can say that sometimes I would use a device to give me the time over a watch or clock. You had to be very careful when working as there  are many little details which you need to look out for. Concentration is the best thing to use when doing these tasks as you are always ready if you are going to make a mistake</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Even though I enjoyed today’s lesson felt like I didn’t go as fast as I could have been going. This may be because of the fact that because I needed to stay concentrated I have to practise
the skill more so it doesn’t hold me up.

 At home I have been trying to improve and fix my blog recently it has not been working well 
However if you are reading this you can be aware that it is working.</td>
