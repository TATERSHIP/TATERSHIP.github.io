We began todays lesson by getting feedback about our blogs. Mine was quite specific to make the titles of my blogs better. Thats this blog has a very unique title showing how I am improving my work. I was pleased with the mark  I got on my blog so if I work on the small things it should hopefully increase. 

Cryptography Is this half term's main point of learning. We are still using google sheets but in a different way. Caesar cipher is a code that is very easy to crack it is simply  a shift code where the letters in the alphabet mean a different letter depending on the shift. For example DCB may not mean anything but if you shift the letters back one letter it says Cab. We are using google sheets to create a tool to decipher our own code or put text into our own code. We use vlookups plenty of ranges and common sense. The next few weeks will challenge me a lot!
