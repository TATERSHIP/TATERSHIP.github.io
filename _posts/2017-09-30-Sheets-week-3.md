Todays lesson was quite hard. I used a function so that I could create a drop down box down box where a customer could choose the type of dodgy market stool item I was selling. I used this function to join up the range of codes with the product. I then was challenged to add things like V.A.T to my form when my teacher called me and my piers to the front I took good notice of what they were doing this helped me work quickly as I understood what I needed to do.

I am on track for a well working spreadsheet and I am very happy with the progress I have made so I will love to get back working on my business and coming up with good ideas.
