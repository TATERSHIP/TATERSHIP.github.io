In the lesson today one of my teachers was talking to us about code and how to overcome challenges. 

We began by making a guide on how to make tea. The guide seemed to be sufficient but when you break it down you realise the problems you are faced with. If you were giving the commands to a robot it would have never even got the water in the kettle. So instead of making a guide of how to make a cup of tea. We made a guide for a robot arm to fill a kettle. 

Know that we knew how to break things down we worked out that a robot arm either uses clockwise or anticlockwise rotation. You can go even deeper and see that it is simply 1's and 0â€™s which are on and off. This would mean 1 would turn on a motor which spins one way and 0 the other. 

So simply any programming is on or off. We then went on a philosophy route talking about 4,5 and 6D shapes and 'The Dress' which people see as different colours.
