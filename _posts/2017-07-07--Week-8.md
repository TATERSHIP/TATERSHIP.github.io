    <td>Today in the exercise I was doing I felt that I wasn't learning new language so I could just write the code and build on my own knowledge. This helped me learn because it meant I could work quicker and because I was doing what I knew I have been  with my friends a lot because It is hard, this makes it more enjoyable and helps me get through the syllabus faster. </td>

    <td>I need to be able to easily remember things from the previous exercises. Because otherwise I have to check the things I have done previously to remember the information on what I was doing </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I need to remember the code better so that I can just get it out of my head. This will improve my learning as I can work quicker and more efficiently and once I remember how to do parts of Python I won't need guidance to code.</td>
