Today was a cover lesson. This meant that my teacher was away and that I had a supply teacher instead. This lesson, I had to make new sheets. The sheets were for, cost, sales and profit and loss. I was focusing on the cost sheet today. We had to think of all of the costs that we would need and then find out how much it actually costs. Some of the costs I had were, The convoy of van I had , maintenance for the van, a warehouse, wifi and some staff.I found out the prices by searching online on vanarama and retail agents around london. I enjoyed finding odd costs and prices that I wouldn't think about normally.
