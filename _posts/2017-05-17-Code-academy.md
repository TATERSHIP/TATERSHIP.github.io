    <td>In this weeks lesson I learnt about strings and console output.

Perseverance helped me get through the challenges of today. Because the code is getting harder it is easier to make mistakes. I was stuck on a whole section just because of one capital letter! We learnt about string methods which alter the string depending on what you code e.g upper() makes all the string go to capitals. If you are wondering what a string is, it is either text or numbers which the console will put on the monitor.

    <td>Next time I need to think about what I'm writing to prevent me needing to read through my work which will waste my time. Even though I wasted time reading through I got into the next exercise about date and time and Iâ€™m halfway through.
