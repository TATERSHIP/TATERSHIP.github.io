  <tr>
    <td>Today I was learning about boolean variables. This was interesting as it was like scratch. Because I knew how to use scratch I could work quickly. I got onto Pyg Latin which I found challenging as it was completely new to me.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Nothing really limited my learning apart from me not knowing what to do. So it was not a habit I need to change I just need to practise and become better</td>
