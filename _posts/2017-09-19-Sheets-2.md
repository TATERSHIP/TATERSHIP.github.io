We began by going into our stock sheet and putting in code to put in a price for manufacturing.We then made the "code" column which meant we didn't have to type the full items name in and just put in 2 letters. We cleared our sale price column and put a number into our manufacturing price column. We then put in profit margin of selling an item. This number is from 0%-100% and will work out what the sale price will be by typing in a formula. We then used VLOOKUP and a code box so that from the the order form where you can choose what you want to order It will tell you want you what the price will be. It took me quite a long time to do this but I reached the end in the lesson making it a successful lesson
