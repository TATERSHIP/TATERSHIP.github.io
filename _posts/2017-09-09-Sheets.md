**_Sheets_**

I have started a new year of i.t at my school and I am carrying on with my blog. Now I am in year 9 the code steps up and we are presented with code in different ways, such as google sheets which is a tool used by most businesses. For the next few blogs it will be about the work I have done using this tool.

We began by going through some simple formulas like product,sum and average which would give you an answer depending of the numbers you put in. We were asked to then change colours text size and add borders. Now that I was introduced we looked at ways of doing things quicker. Using formulas that would work out all your data. It was called Vlookup. It would check the data you were testing using a range you had previously created. We are making spreadsheets for businesses and my business is a dodgy market stool/shop. 

A good start to the year!
