We began the lesson by talking about when and why we would need spreadsheets. I knew that spreadsheets were used in a lot of business and for taxes as my mum and dad use them a lot. So when I am older there's a very high chance that I will use a spreadsheet in my work.

We then started on discount codes we had to make 3 codes at three different discounts and names so that if we typed in the code it would tell you how much of a discount you would get. 

For my code I simply used my initials with as different number at the end of it. I got my code to see if the code was real work out how much percent it was. However I am still struggling on how to get the amount of money that I needed to take away from my total.

I have enjoyed working on this project this half term and I can't wait to see what my teacher has for us to do next term.
