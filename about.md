Why I'm doing this:

I have begun a term of I.t where I am now learning about a type of code called Python. I am using a resource called CodeAcademy to help me learn and practise my skills.

About Me:

I enjoy playing different sports like football, basketball and cricket. I also like playing video games. I support two football teams, Arsenal amd Newcastle. My favourite basketball team is the New York Knicks as some of my family used to live their. Unfortunately the Knicks aren't the best team in the NBA.
